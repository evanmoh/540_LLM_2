Staging Systems  
The Veterans Administration ( VA) Lung Study Group’s 2 stage 
classification scheme has historically been used to define the extent of 
disease in patients with SCLC: 1) limited stage is disease confined to the 
ipsilateral hemithorax, which can be safely encompassed within a radiation 
field; and 2) extensive stage is disease beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax, 
including malignant pleural /pericardial effusion or hematogenous 
metastases.70 Contr alateral mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy are generally classified as limited stage SCLC , whereas 
the classification of contralateral hilar and supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy is more controversial and treatment is 
individualized.17,71,72",SCLC

The majority of SCLCs are reactive to markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, including insulinomaassociated protein 1 (INSM1), CD56/NCAM, 
synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Fewer than 5% of SCLCs are negative for all neuroendocrine markers.11,12 For cases with suspicious SCLC morphology 
without expression of neuroendocrine markers, POU2F3 immunohistochemical staining can be considered.13,14

Additional immunohistochemical markers are useful in distinguishing small cell carcinoma from poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma and combined
