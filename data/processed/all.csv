 SCLC can be diagnosed on goodquality histologic samples via highquality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained sections or on wellpreserved cytologic 
samples.  
SCLC is characterized by small blue cells with scant cytoplasm, high nucleartocytoplasmic ratio, granular chromatin, and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli.

Staging Systems  
The Veterans Administration ( VA) Lung Study Group’s 2 stage 
classification scheme has historically been used to define the extent of 
disease in patients with SCLC: 1) limited stage is disease confined to the 
ipsilateral hemithorax, which can be safely encompassed within a radiation 
field; and 2) extensive stage is disease beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax, 
including malignant pleural /pericardial effusion or hematogenous 
metastases.70 Contr alateral mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy are generally classified as limited stage SCLC , whereas 
the classification of contralateral hilar and supraclavicular
